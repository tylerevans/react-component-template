# React Component Template

### Template to publish your react components to NPM.

Having developed many React Components I have reused across multiple projects (such as loading screen), rather than copy and paste the code to new project, this template can be used to build and publish your own components to NPM.

To use, do the following:

 * Develop your component in index.js
 * npm install any specific libraries required by your component.
 * Build the component to dist/build.js
 * Publish to NPM

```javascript
npm install
npm run build
```
